This is a demo of the prototype we have developed.
The demo is intended only for visualization and testing purposes. Some software features have been disabled.
User can load differents 3D models. Users can also modify the stop pointsof the applicator to observe its
influence over the dosimetry. The applicator stop times at every position have been implemented in the full
version of the prototype. This feateure is not enabled for this demo, so the times have been fixed as the
ones used to simulate the treatment applied to the clinical case represented by the provided model "sarcoma_1.ply".

Instructions:

1. Download *.m, *.p and *.ply files.
2. Open Matlab and navigate to the folder where the files have been stored.
3. Open the file main.m.
4. Execute the program by typing main on the command window or by pressing the Run button.
5. A new window will open. It will show the dosimetry map over the model. The user can rotate it,
zoom in and out and pick points to obtain their coordinates and dosimetry value.
6. Modify the application points at your own to observe the changes in the dosimetry map and run 
the simulation again.
7. Use a new model
